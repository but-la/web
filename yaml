# Configurations for Development Environment

This configuration file specifies the settings used when running the application in a development environment.

## Configuration keys and description:

- `address`: The network address that the server listens on, which is port 8080 on all interfaces in this case.
- `store`: Configuration settings related to data storage.
  - `datastore`: Settings for the datastore to be used.
    - `env`: The name of the environment variable that contains the datastore's configuration, which is "DATASTORE" here.
- `host`: Configuration for the hostname.
  - `scheme`: The protocol scheme used for the URL, which is "https" here.
  - `hostname`: The fully qualified domain name where the development server can be accessed, e.g., "dev.but.la".

Make sure to provide a valid `DATASTORE` environment variable that the application can use to connect to the appropriate datastore instance.
